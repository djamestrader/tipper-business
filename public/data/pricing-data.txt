Everything You Need to Know About Your Skip Bin Hire
Detailed Breakdown of Additional Charges and Waste Acceptance

When it comes to managing your waste disposal, understanding the details of skip bin hire is crucial. Our comprehensive guide not only clarifies the additional charges that may apply to certain items but also outlines what waste is accepted, ensuring you make the most informed decisions for your project. From tackling extra fees head-on to navigating the do’s and don’ts of waste disposal. Let’s dive into the details to help you save time and avoid any surprises.
Individually Charged Items

Not all waste is treated equally. Some items are recyclable, while others are not. For this reason, the following items incur individual charges to ensure responsible disposal:

    Mattresses $110:
    A charge of $110 applies for any size mattress (cot, single, double, queen, king), reflecting the extra steps required for their environmentally friendly disposal.

    Tyres $77:
    Standard car and truck tyres are subject to a $77 fee, to cover the costs associated with processing.

    Other Items $33
    For specific items like paint tins, gas bottles, and extinguishers, a fee of $33 is added to manage their safe and compliant disposal.

Overloaded Weight Charge

When hiring a bin from us, keep in mind that the price includes disposal of up to 1000 kilograms of waste. Should your load exceed this limit, an Overload Weight Fee applies:

    Fee $33 Per 100 Kilograms:
    $33 for every additional 100 kilograms, or $330 per ton beyond the included weight.

This means if your waste surpasses the included weight, the extra will be charged on top of your initial bin hire cost. We’re transparent with our process and can provide weighbridge dockets upon request to ensure you’re informed about the weight of your disposed waste.

Example for Clarity:

    You choose a 4m³ skip bin for household junk, priced at $550.

    Your total disposed waste weighs 1200 kilograms, which is 200 kilograms over the included limit.

    The first 1000 kilograms are covered by your initial payment.

    The extra 200 kilograms will incur a fee of $66 ($33 per 100 kilograms).

    Your total cost will be $616 for disposing of 1200 kilograms of waste.

Please remember, the maximum weight limit for any of our skip bins is 1500 kilograms to ensure safe and compliant transport.
Extra Daily Charge Hire

When you hire a skip bin from us, it comes with a standard 7-day rental period, which is included in your base price. If your project needs a bit more time, we’ve got you covered, but please note:

    Extended Rental Fee $33 Per Day:
    An additional charge of $33 per day applies for each day beyond the included 7 days.

This flexible option allows you to manage your project timelines without rushing, ensuring you can complete your clean-up at your own pace. Our hiring terms can be adjusted if you need those extra days.
Unacceptable Waste and Items

For a smooth and safe skip bin hire experience, it’s important to know what types of waste you can and cannot place in our bins. Some items require special handling and might not be accepted due to their nature. Here’s a breakdown:
